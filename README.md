- PDF Document (.pdf): Presents the summarized list of colleges for each board in a PDF format.
- Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx): Organizes the data in an Excel spreadsheet for easy analysis.
- JSON File (.json): Represents the data in JSON format.

## Usage

You can use the data in the preferred format for your analysis or information needs. Below are instructions for each format:

- **SQLite Database (.db)**: You can import the .db file into any SQLite-compatible software or use it with programming languages that support SQLite connectivity.

- **SQL Script (.sql)**: Execute the SQL script on your preferred database system to create tables and insert data. Modify the script to suit your needs.

- **CSV Files (.csv)**: Each board and college has a separate CSV file. You can open them with spreadsheet software or use programming languages for data manipulation.

- **PDF Document (.pdf)**: Open the PDF document to quickly view a summarized list of colleges for each board.

- **Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx)**: Open the Excel spreadsheet to perform data analysis, filtering, and sorting easily.

- **JSON File (.json)**: The JSON file contains the data in a structured format. You can use it with various programming languages for data processing.

## Database Schema

If you're using the SQLite database or SQL script, the database schema includes tables like 'boards', 'colleges', etc. Here's a high-level overview:

- 'boards' table: Contains information about different boards.
- 'colleges' table: Stores data about various colleges, including board, name, location, etc.

Modify the schema as per your requirements or extend it with additional tables if necessary.
